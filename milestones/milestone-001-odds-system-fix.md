# Milestone 001: Odds System Documentation & Display Fix
*Created: January 3, 2025*  
*Target Completion: January 10, 2025*  
*Status: ðŸŸ¡ Planning*

## Problem Statement
User enters 2.60 decimal odds on frontend â†’ sees 2.59 on profile page â†’ wastes hours debugging whether bug is in contracts, Firebase, or frontend. Need to understand and document the complete odds flow, then fix display inconsistencies.

## The Odds Confusion (Current Understanding)

### What We Know
- **Contract uses**: Decimal odds (easier for payout calculations)
- **Two users needed**: Maker (creates odds) + Taker (matches position)
- **Example**: 2.60 decimal odds for maker means taker gets different odds
- **Problem**: Frontend shows 2.59 instead of 2.60 entered
- **Storage**: Contract uses "odds pair IDs" that are confusing to decode

### What We Need to Figure Out
1. **Exact conversion flow**: Frontend input â†’ Contract storage â†’ Firebase â†’ Frontend display
2. **Odds pair relationship**: If maker gets 2.60, what does taker get?
3. **Odds pair ID meaning**: What does the ID stored in Firebase represent?
4. **Rounding issues**: Where does 2.60 become 2.59?

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Document complete odds conversion flow
- Create odds reference chart (decimal â†” american â†” contract representation)
- Fix frontend display rounding issues  
- Create debugging tools for odds validation
- Test with current deployed contracts (no redeployment needed)

### Out of Scope
- Contract logic changes
- New odds features
- Leaderboard rules (separate milestone)
- American odds input (decimal input only for now)

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Map the Current Flow (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Step 1**: Trace the exact 2.60 â†’ 2.59 conversion
  - `CreateUnmatchedPairModal.tsx` (line 229): User enters 2.60
  - `createUnmatchedPair.ts` (line 45): Converts to `Math.floor(2.60 * 10_000_000) = 26,000,000`
  - Contract creates position with oddsPairId
  - `oddsCalculations.ts`: `calculateOddsFromId()` converts back to decimal
  - `Positions.tsx` (line 458): `getOddsForPosition()` displays the result

- [ ] **Step 2**: Debug the reverse calculation
  - Test `calculateOddsFromId()` with known oddsPairIds
  - Check if the `Math.floor(upperOdds / (ODDS_PRECISION / 100)) / 100` operation causes 2.59
  - Document the exact precision loss point

- [ ] **Step 3**: Compare with contract expectations
  - Verify if contract actually stores 26,000,000 correctly
  - Check if oddsPairId generation is working as expected
  - Compare maker vs taker odds calculations

- [ ] **Step 4**: Validate Firebase data consistency  
  - Confirm Firebase receives correct oddsPairId from contract events
  - Check `convertFirebaseToPosition()` in dataConversions.ts (lines 315-384)
  - Verify position.poolId matches contract oddsPairId

## Staging for Deployment

**Status**: Changes committed to milestone branch, ready to batch with other fixes

**Deployment Requirements:**
1. Deploy updated PositionModule.sol with new `getOrCreateOddsPairId()` signature
2. Update event emissions in `createUnmatchedPair()` to include odds values:
   ```solidity
   (uint128 oddsPairId, uint64 upperOdds, uint64 lowerOdds) = getOrCreateOddsPairId(odds, positionType);
   
   emit PositionCreated(speculationId, msg.sender, oddsPairId, unmatchedExpiry, positionType, amount, upperOdds, lowerOdds);
   ```
3. Update Firebase event handlers to capture and store `upperOdds` and `lowerOdds` fields
4. Remove `calculateOddsFromId()` JavaScript function (no longer needed)
5. Update frontend to read odds directly from Firebase instead of calculating

**Batching Strategy**: Deploy with leaderboard fee fix for coordinated single deployment

## Success Metrics Achieved âœ…

### Technical Acceptance âœ…
- [x] Identified exact source of 2.60 â†’ 2.59 display bug  
- [x] Can explain maker/taker odds relationship (2.60 maker gets 1.63 taker)
- [x] Contract data verified as accurate via DecodePosition.s.sol script
- [x] Have solution to display contract values directly without calculation

### Documentation Acceptance âœ…  
- [x] Complete understanding of odds conversion flow documented
- [x] Root cause analysis shows events missing actual odds data
- [x] Solution eliminates need for error-prone JavaScript reverse calculation

### Process Acceptance âœ…
- [x] Work done on milestone branch with clear commits
- [x] AI session notes documented for future reference
- [x] Staging approach planned for coordinated deployment

## Lessons Learned

1. **Contract events should include calculated values, not just IDs** - saves complex reverse calculations
2. **JavaScript precision differs from Solidity** - avoid reverse-engineering contract math in frontend
3. **Test contract data directly** - DecodePosition.s.sol script was invaluable for verification
4. **Storage references eliminate code duplication** - cleaner than multiple memory copies
5. **Batch related changes** - deploy contract fixes together rather than separately

## Files Modified
- `src/modules/PositionModule.sol` - Updated `getOrCreateOddsPairId()` function

## Files To Update (Next Deployment)
- Event emissions in `createUnmatchedPair()`
- Firebase event handlers 
- Frontend odds display logic
- Remove `src/utils/oddsCalculations.ts` (no longer needed)

## Next Steps
- Merge with leaderboard fee fix in single deployment milestone
- Update Foundry tests to handle new return signature
- Plan Firebase event handler updates
- Test complete flow after deployment

## Milestone Completion Workflow

**For future reference, here's how to complete milestones:**

### During Milestone
1. Update status as tasks complete: ðŸŸ¡ Planning â†’ ðŸŸ  In Progress â†’ âœ… Complete
2. Document discoveries and decisions in real-time
3. Commit code changes to milestone branch regularly

### Completing Milestone  
1. **Update milestone file** with final status and results (like this)
2. **Document lessons learned** for future milestones
3. **List all files modified** for deployment tracking
4. **Plan next steps** or dependencies
5. **Merge milestone branch** to main when ready to deploy

### After Completion
1. **Create next milestone** based on learnings and next priorities
2. **Archive completed milestone** (keep file for reference)
3. **Update system-overview.md** if architecture changed

*This milestone successfully eliminated the 2.60 â†’ 2.59 display bug and established the milestone-driven workflow.*

# Ospex Development Documentation

Internal development documentation for the Ospex peer-to-peer sports betting platform.

## What's This Repo For?

This repository contains architecture documentation, development milestones, workflows, and internal processes for the Ospex development team. This is **not** user-facing documentation - that lives in a separate repo and is deployed as a public website.

## Repository Structure

```
/architecture/          - System overviews, component docs, technical specs
/milestones/            - Milestone tracking files with completion status  
/workflows/             - Git workflow, testing procedures, deployment guides
/ai-sessions/           - Saved AI conversation notes and code sessions
```
